            Pinterest is a visual search engine that allows users to explore and save different ideas and inspirations. 
            With over 86 million users, Pinterest is one of the largest social media networks in the world.

            <h3> Background</h3>
            <p>
               In class I learned that microinteractions engage users and brings delight in small moments. To apply this knowledge, 
               I envisioned and developed my own microinteractions in the span of 10 weeks. I chose Pinterest as an interesting website/app 
               to redesign for because of the potential to pull in the branding into the microninteraction.

            <h3> Problem</h3>
            <p>
                 Throughout the evolution of my microinteraction, I had to consider what could bring delight without loosing the existing functionality. 
                 I also had to consider the feasability within the timeline I was given with 1-2 weeks for each level of microinteraction.

        <p>
            I first decided to redesign the "save pin" interaction because it was an critical part of the website's functionality. 
            I started to envision my updated microinteraction through a static protoype created on Figma which showed what would happen when a user would
            interact with it. I used a pin icon to

            The final build is responsive and functional. Despite working it still runs a few bugs that I did not have time to fix.
